love they say is a virtue
ever since the fall of man it has been an issue
love they say conquers the world
it is now a nuclear weapon that is causing chaos
we are now in aworld where trust is now a scarce commodity
where there is absence of peace and correct unity
we have seen cases where siblings turn against one another
where best friends lay your death bed
even parent neglect their own children
you see, in the chase of love
many destinies have been crushed
what was suppose to be a heart builder now an heart breaker
because the man Jesus that was suppose to be at the center have been pushed to the corner
sodom and gomorrah are saints when compared to the atrocity we create
satan is greatly on the move to push men towards hell gate
even those we least expect, 
i mean God very own elect
are fast becoming hell candidate
we begin to ask ourselves, does love really exist
if it does exist, where can we find it
what we call love today is a bag full of lust
the issue of boyfriend and girlfriend is now a normal language
all in the quest to exercise youthful lust
and get what thy can gain
some the body, some moneyand sme to play games
self love disguising itself as true love
lesbianism and gay relationsip sef no carry last
pornography in our present world has built itself an house
where masturbation has it own flat
son of men now celebrate porn stars
matter of disgust, now peoples's culture
in the quest of satisfication,
son of men run into confusion
they keep looking for gold in the dungeon 
is there a solution to all this mess
those love truly exist
if it does where can we find it
where can we find this satisfaction
where can we find the orderliness to this confusion
herein is love
that God sent his only begotten son to die for the world
while we were yet sinners he died for us.
though we were his foes yet he didn't withold.
he invested in a business that is going down the hole
though reckless he didn't hold back because to save huamnity was his goal
with so much love in his heart
he saying dear I love you
if you must hear that again i really really love you
see, i won't difficult for you
i am not playing hard to get
listen you dont to prove a thing
i love you just as you are
neither do you have to do anything
maybe you are trying to pretend to  be who you are not or trying prove youur worthiness
all those doesn't matter to me
just because you are a creature of the living God 
that made earn my love.
He that made you made you beautiful and wonderful
so all i need from you is your trust, faith and hope in me.
yeah simply your trust
let go of all the love
and make me your all in all
your one and only
then wouid i be your prince charming.
I don't care about your past 
elope with me and leave everything behind
so great is my show of love toward you
the very hair of your hair have numbered
when my life  was on the line to prove my love 
i didn't hide in the heaven's top rather i came down and took the cross
i became poor so you could be okay
i became homeless so you could have roof on over head
i took your place of death so i can give you rest 
i did all that just so that i could win your heart
just so that i could have you a better life
others may knock at your money, some your body and others your life
but i knock sofly at the door of your heart
beloved open and don't say no
don't push me away, don't lock your heart from my love
parent may desert you, friends may abadon you, but i will never leave nor forsake you
i know the world out there is full of deceit and lies
but i assure your life is safe in my hands
with me your heart won't suffer a crack not to talk of breaking your heart
if i could lay my life for you 
what more can't i do for you
everything you will need for life and godliness have i provided
because i don't want you to worry about anything
cast all your cares and butrden on me have got you covered
don't worry you can't chase me your problem
they can't be too much
i told you to bring them and bring them all
come unto me with your heavy laden and i will give you rest
i will give you the satisfaction that the world lacks
i will fill the void within your heart
if you need an arm to cry on i have got an everlasting arm
tell me all that bugs you, even those that looks impossible
you would be surprised how  i would make you cool
were you looking for love
Herein is love, 
not that we loved God, 
but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins
it is in me and only me you can find true love.
It is in Jesus and only in Him you can find true love
