it all started in the beginning 
all void and darkness on the face of the deep
from mere dust, common dust, ordinary dust was formed a being
a being called MAN
God in his image and likeness created he him
man was given everything
dominion over the fish of the sea
over the birds of the air
over every creeping thing that creepeth on earth
he was given so much wealth that the angels can't comprehend
the King of kings visits him himself
he was given so much previledge
even in his glory and wealth
the one thing he was not to get, he covet
what he was not to eat, he ate
who he was not to meet he met
he was deceived and he rebelled
what a fall, what a mistake
that great glory has been turned to shame
what a wretched state
a man of dominion now a slave
he lost a fountain of water to a lake
of all he lost the most painful of all
was his fellowship with his creator
he sought it with all he got
did all his best to fill the void
but still he never gets satisfied
who shall save him from this state he is in
battered and tortured by his sin
who shall save his soul from perishing
he is dying he need a medicine
for God who is rich in mercy
look down and had pity 
and sent his only begotten son to die for him
restoring man back to his former glory
christ was bruised for our diseases
so man is lifted high above sickness 
christ became nothing
for man to gain everything
God his so merciful that he did all without collecting a penny
praying for 24 hours per day won't help you get it
fasting for the the whole year is not a criteria
don't you get it, nothing from you is required
he just want you to believe in his saving power
he can save even a murderer, a robber or a drunkard
just believe and you will be delivered
mercy ecountered
